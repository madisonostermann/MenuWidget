# MenuWidget

I was tired of seeing & using the same old tab view navigation in apps, so I created a menu widget that mixes up navigation a little, without making it overly complicated or confusing. While it’s built in SwiftUI, there are ways to integrate it with UIKit views.

It’s also incredibly easy to swap in your own colors (gradients even!), icons, screens, etc. You can even change it to expand horizontally or close when you tap any of the buttons, not just the chevron arrow.

I wrote a Medium tutorial about how I built this widget if you'd like to check that out: https://medium.com/@mmgipson3/swiftui-menu-widget-easy-to-customize-integrate-75a36f067d83
